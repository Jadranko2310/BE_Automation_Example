# BE_Automation_Example
This project is designed to show project structure, code style and organization of the tests. 
Due to this purpose, it is not testing the actual application, but sending requests to created mock server.
Different mock servers will be built in test executing runtime and if TestNG listener find the annotation for special mock server,
it will be build (This can be found in configuration folder).
Also, this project is not focused on showing the large number of tests, but more project setup, objects, data organization etc.
